# Topology Optimization of Wind Farm Layouts   

MATLAB code for topology optimization of wind farm layouts.   

The code implements the optimization approach proposed in: Pollini, N. (2022). Topology optimization of wind farm layouts. Renewable Energy, 195, 1015-1027.   

      
<b>Example</b>

Initial grid of wind turbines. There are 124 potential wind turbine. During the optimization analysis, a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 64 wind turbines are allowed to be placed.
